# Quickstart
- Clone the repo
- Open in vs code
- Open command palatte ( ctrl+shift+p) and type in snippet and then click on new global snippet
- Paste the content of the file 1.json in the editor and save the file. Now whenever cp is typed in the editor, vs code would give the option of inserting this snippet in the editor
- In the editor also create the file debug.cpp to use the debug statement.
- From the snippets directory create any other useful snippets of your choice using the above method.
